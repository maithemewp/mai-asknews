The Yankees are coming off a series victory against the Boston Red Sox and are looking to continue their strong hitting. The Phillies, on the other hand, are struggling, having lost their last series to the Cleveland Guardians. The game will feature a matchup between Gil and Wheeler, with the Yankees looking to solve Wheeler's dominance at home. The Phillies will need their hitters to be sharp and make contact against a good pitcher. The Yankees are favored to win, but the game is expected to go down to the wire.",

The author predicts that the Phillies will win the game due to their strong offense, which has been shown in their recent game where four players hit homers and had a dozen hits. The author also mentions that the Phillies are 38-17 at home, while the Guardians are 29-27 on the road. The author suggests that Trea Turner will get a hit again and recommends a same-game parlay. The total is set at 9.5 with two lackluster pitchers on the mound, making the author's prediction for the Under.",

The Yankees fought back to win 11-8 against the Red Sox on Saturday, but the Red Sox are still in the hunt for the division title. Boston has a legitimate superstar in Rafael Devers, but lacks high-end pitching. The Red Sox traded for catcher Danny Jansen, signaling they are all-in on making a run at the Yankees and Orioles. Carlos Rodon has settled down and emerged from his rough patch, while Tanner Houck has been tremendous for Boston. Houck needs to stand tall and deliver for his team, and the Red Sox would rather have him on the mound than any other starter. The price is right at -112, making the Sox moneyline the play.",

The system involves betting on any team that lost its previous game by at least 11 points, as long as they are facing a different opponent. The expert analyzes the performance of this system over the past two seasons, combining the results of 31 bets with an average decimal odds of 2.06. The expert's pick is that the Red Sox will win against the Yankees and the Blue Jays will rebound against the Rangers. The expert is not confident in the first pick but will follow the 'La d\u00e9gel\u00e9e 3' system. The expert likes the matchup between Andrew Heaney and Yusei Kikuchi, and thinks that the Blue Jays will stop their losing streak.",
