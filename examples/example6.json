The game saw several notable moments, including Cleveland's designated hitter David Fry hitting a three-run home run in the third inning. Fry's home run was followed by a double play by Cleveland's shortstop Brayan Rocchio, forcing out Baltimore's left fielder Colton Cowser. The Orioles' starting pitcher Trevor Rogers struggled, giving up a three-run home run to Fry. The game's outcome is not specified in the article, but it appears to be a highlight reel of key moments from the game.",

      "summary": "The Baltimore Orioles are set to begin a 10-game road trip against the Cleveland Guardians, but they will have to adjust to the absence of injured All-Star third baseman Jordan Westburg. Westburg sustained a fractured right hand after being hit by a fastball, and manager Brandon Hyde is hopeful he will return late in the regular season. In the meantime, the Orioles will have to rely on other players to fill the void in their lineup. Meanwhile, the Guardians are coming off a strong performance, having won three of their last four games, including a 5-0 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Jose Ramirez has been on a hot streak, belting his third homer in the past two games, and Josh Naylor and Brayan Rocchio also went deep for the Guardians. The Guardians will turn to right-hander Ben Lively, who has a 9-6 record and a 3.44 ERA, to face the Orioles in the series opener. Lively has yet to face Baltimore in his career, and the Orioles have yet to announce their starting pitcher for the game. As Jackson Holliday said, 'It's pretty surreal' to be back in the majors after a dismal start, and he is excited to help the team win. However, he also acknowledged that 'when I was struggling, I felt like I couldn't really do that. But to come through in a big spot is more important to me than anything else.' ",
